      <p>
        In addition to my work as a professional software engineer,
        in my spare time I work as a freelancer, designing and developing websites for small businesses.
        While each client presents unique challenges, I focus on two main themes:
      </p>
      <p>Beautiful design</p>
      <p>Powerful engineering</p>
      <p>I want your website to function like a sports car. Sleek design with an engine under the hood that flies</p>
      <p>Features of sites:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Responsive, mobile friendly</li>
        <li>Google Analyitcs tracking</li>
        <li>Monthly Google Analyitcs dashboard sent to each customer</li>
        <li>SEO best practices</li>
        <li>Figma</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tech stack:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Heroku</li>
        <li>NodeJs</li>
        <li>Express</li>
        <li>Sass</li>
